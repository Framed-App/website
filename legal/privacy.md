The developers of Framed (hereinafter "Framed", "we", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the Framed website and governs data collection and usage. By using the Framed website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information

Framed may collect personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Framed also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your Postal code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Framed. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Framed for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Framed website. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Framed public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Framed does not read any of your private online communications. Framed encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Framed, so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Framed is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Framed and family of websites.
Use of your Personal Information

Framed collects the following:

- IP addresses: Your IP address may be logged to help us identify most common times of activity and for tracking intrusion attempts and DDoS attempts. This information is kept for 7 days, but may be kept as long as it is needed when investigating security incidents or server issues.
- Email addresses, names: This information is used to respond to enquiries. This is kept for as long as it is needed.
- Website usage data: How you interact with the website is tracked (pages visited, the duration of the visit, previous visits), how you access the website (device information, time accessed, city, how you found the website, web browser, operating system) are collected. This is done through a third-party service called Cloudflare Analytics (view their privacy policy [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/)). This information is used to provide general statistics and to maintain quality of service.
- App usage data: In the event of an app crash, data about the crash (such as your last actions leading up to the crash) are sent to Sentry (view their privacy policy [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/)). This helps us better understand the cause of crashes, and allows us to fix bugs quicker than we would otherwise be able to. This data is kept for 30 days, and does not contain any personally identifiable information.

Framed collects and uses your personal information to operate the Framed website and deliver the services you have requested. Framed also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Framed and its affiliates. Framed may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. Framed does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Framed may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.

In addition, Framed may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, arrange for deliveries, or otherwise help provide the service. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Framed, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Framed does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

Framed keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within the Framed website, in order to determine what Framed services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Framed to customers whose behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Framed websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Framed or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Framed; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Framed or the public.

- Framed uses a third-party service, Cloudflare, to secure the Site and speed up performance. Cloudflare's Analytics service is also used. For more information about Cloudflareâ€™s privacy practices, see their [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/)
- Some Framed websites/services are hosted on Vercel. You can read their privacy policy [here](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)
